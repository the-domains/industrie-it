# SpaceX tries a third launch attempt and daring landing (SES-9)

Twice SpaceX [attempted][0] to launch the SES-9 communications satellite into space last week, and twice the rocket company had to scrub. The reason was not weather, but rather issues with ensuring the rocket was fueled with the right amount of liquid oxygen postponed the festivities.

With its new, more powerful variant of the Falcon 9 rocket, SpaceX is having to handle this super-cold, dense propellant more carefully, and one of the things it is trying to do is deliver the right amount of fuel just before launch. With near perfect weather conditions expected for launch today, look for that to be the main issue to watch as SpaceX counts down toward the 6:46pm ET opening of the launch window.

As with other recent launches, SpaceX will try yet again to fly its booster back to an automated ship in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Florida. However, because this is a high orbit (about 35,000km above the equator) and will require a heavy vehicle with more fuel and more speed, returning safely back to Earth is far from a sure thing. Additionally, at 5,300kg, this is the heaviest payload SpaceX has attempted to deliver to a geostationary orbit.

Still, the company says it will make another attempt at a historic first, landing an orbital rocket on a sea-based platform. "The first stage of the Falcon 9 will attempt an experimental landing on the 'Of Course I Still Love You' droneship," SpaceX said in its [press kit][1]. "Given this mission's unique GTO profile, a successful landing is not expected."

The [webcast][2] below will begin at about 6:25pm ET.

### About

SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket will deliver SES-9, a commercial communications satellite for SES, to a Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO). SES is a world-leading satellite operator that provides satellite-enabled communications services to broadcasters, Internet service providers, mobile and fixed network operators, and business and governmental organizations worldwide using its fleet of more than 50 geostationary satellites. SpaceX is targeting an evening launch of SES-9 from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Fla. The approximately 90-minute launch window opens on February 25 at 6:46 pm ET. The satellite will be deployed approximately 31 minutes after liftoff.
